## Hi there 👋

I'm a physics bachelor at the University of Heidelberg, navigating the cosmos (of code). 🌌👩🏽‍💻
While Python is my main coding companion (with packages like pandas🐼, astropy, and astroquery), I also dabble in C++, stilts (java based), and ADQL. 
When I’m not busy with University assignments or on the field playing Volleyball, I'm probably lost in the mysteries of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). 🚀🔭

From April to September 2024 I completed an internship at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) filtering known AGNs from observations in the JWST archive. ⚫️👾
