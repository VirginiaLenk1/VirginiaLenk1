## Hi there 👋

I'm a physics master student at the University of Heidelberg, navigating the cosmos (of code). 🌌👩🏽‍💻
While Python is my main coding companion, I also dabble in C++, stilts (java based), and ADQL. 
When I’m not busy with University assignments or on the field playing Volleyball, I'm probably researching Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). 

From April to September 2024 I completed an internship at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) filtering known AGNs from observations in the JWST archive. ⚫️👾
