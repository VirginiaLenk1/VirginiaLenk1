## Hi there 👋

I'm a physics bachelor at the University of Heidelberg, navigating the cosmos of code. 🌌👩🏽‍💻
Most of my projects are in Python—because it sounds cooler than other coding languages? 🐍 
When I’m not crunching numbers or or decoding data, I'm probably lost in the mysteries of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). 🚀🔭

Right now, I’m working at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) on AGNs in the JWST archive, filtering known AGNs from observations in eJWST. ⚫️👾

While Python is my main coding companion (with packages like pandas🐼, astropy, and astroquery), I also dabble in C++, stilts (java based), and ADQL. 
If you’re into data analysis and cosmic wonders, you’ve found your spot! 🌌
